This plugin basically turns any bow into a TON of fun!

Allow your players to decide what they shoot with their arrows. Spider jockeys? Sponge items? It's up to your imagination!

Note the plugin defaults! There is a default whitelist on GRAVEL. Server admins NEED to adjust the settings before doing anything!

Permissions need to be given in the form of:

* bowsplus.material
* bowsplus.entitytype
